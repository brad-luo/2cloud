Pre-interview tasks

## Task A

Task A is implemented using pure html/css/js/python without 
extra third-party libraries. Also, it approaches the separation of front-end and back-end,
which means that the front-end and back-end can be deployed on different servers without 
any interference.

## Task B

Making good use of Django template engine can save a lot of time, web pages are rendered on the serve side.
